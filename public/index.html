    <h1>Recipes ReST API</h1>

    <p>
      Using the recipe database you created in Lab 3 as the backend database, please use Express to create a REST API with the following endpoints:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>List all recipes</li>
      <li>Search recipe names using MongoDB's text search.</li>
      <li>Search recipes that use certain ingredients (for example "beef" and "potato").</li>
      <li>Add a recipe.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Please submit the code in a zip file.
      And in addition to the code, please also submit a Postman test requests collection.
      The collection should include at least one test request for each endpoint.
    </p>
