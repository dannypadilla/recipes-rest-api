# Recipes ReST API

---

Using the recipe database you created in Lab 3 as the backend database, please use Express to create a REST API with the following endpoints:


1. List all recipes
2. Search recipe names using MongoDB's text search.
3. Search recipes that use certain ingredients (for example "beef" and "potato").
4. Add a recipe.


Please submit the code in a zip file. And in addition to the code, please also submit a Postman test requests collection. The collection should include at least one test request for each endpoint.
